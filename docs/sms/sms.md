## The different SMS APIs

### [REST](doc:sms-rest)
The easiest and most feature-rich API we offer. It allows for single messages, scheduled batch sending, message templates and more. You can also use our server-side libraries if you like to work natively in your programming language of choice.

### [SMPP](doc:sms-smpp)
SMPP interfaces for full control and low latency.

## Getting started
Getting started with the Sinch SMS API is simple.
- Create an SMS account in the [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/#/signup)
